# StudentApi

This repository contains a StudentAPI built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The API serves as a backend solution for managing student information and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records.

## Features:

RESTful API: The API follows REST principles, providing a standardized and scalable approach for interacting with student data.
Node.js and Express.js: The API is built using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, and Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework. This combination allows for efficient handling of HTTP requests and easy routing.
MongoDB: The API integrates with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, to store and retrieve student records. MongoDB's flexible schema makes it suitable for handling dynamic and evolving data.
CRUD Operations: The API supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on student records. You can add new students, retrieve student details, update student information, and delete student records.
Validation and Error Handling: Input validation and error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages in case of any issues.
Authentication and Authorization: Optional authentication and authorization mechanisms can be implemented to secure the API and restrict access to authorized users.
Pagination and Sorting: Pagination and sorting options are available to efficiently manage large datasets and retrieve specific subsets of student records.
Filtering and Searching: The API supports filtering and searching capabilities, allowing you to find students based on specific criteria or search terms.
